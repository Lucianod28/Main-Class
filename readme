Our game is based off of Atari Centipede. It is quite simple. Not all the functionality is there as of now, so things like the target status and a message when you win or lose will not work. This project was done by Luciano de la Iglesia and Jonathan Shen for an AP Computer Science at RHS in 2016. To start the game, run Game.java.
