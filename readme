Our game is based off of Atari Centipede. It is quite simple. Not all the functionality is there as of now, so things like the target status and a message when you win or lose will not work. This project was done mostly by Luciano de la Iglesia and Jonathan Shen, with some help by Shlok Wagle. To start the game, run Game.java.
